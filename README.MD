# Rust -> CPP FFI Pipeline Example
This is a simple example of how to use Rust and C++ together using the Foreign Function Interface (FFI). This example demonstrates how to call a C++ function from Rust.

## Projects
This repository contains two projects:
1. [`src-rust`](src-rust/): A Rust project that calls a C++ function.
2. [`src-cpp`](src-cpp/): A C++ project that contains the function that is called by the Rust project.
